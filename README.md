This is a web chat app, similar to whatsapp web, and it's still under heavy (but slow) development.

**Current avail features:**

  * Register using Google account, to enable file sharing through Google Drive API,
  * Add friend using friend's email address,
  * Accept or reject friendship request,
  * Person to person chat,
  * Persistence chat,
  * Create a group and its initial members,
  * Accept or reject group's membership request.
  * Group chat.

**Features that are still under development:**

  * File sharing through Google Drive API,
  * Managing group (e.g. invite new member, remove member and etc),
  * Video conference through WebRTC (like Hangout)

**Features that need to redo logically:**

  * Relation between 2 persons

**NOTE**
I won't be able to support any body who is using this source code, as this is just an experimental
project that is still under heavy but slow development, due to the fact that I'm still under company's payroll.
