  * Add friend using friend's email address,
  * Accept or reject friendship request,
  * Person to person chat,
  * Persistence chat,
  * Create a group and invite members to it,
  * Accept or reject group's membership request.

**Features still under development:**

  * Group chat,
  * File sharing through Google Drive API,
  * Managing group (e.g. invite new member, remove member and etc),
  * Video conference through WebRTC (like Hangout)

**NOTE**
I won't be able to support any body who is using this source code, as this is just an experimental
project that is still under heavy but slow development, due to the fact that I'm still under company's payroll.
